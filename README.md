# (Loan Data from Prosper)
## by (Gladys Mwangi)


## Dataset

> 
In this project I selected a dataset from Prosper.com This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. With so many variable it was hard to  get started without any financial knowledge. Thanks to Propers.com who  provided detailed description for each variable. So the first step before  conducting any data analysis is to understand the meaning of each variable.  After reading through the descriptions and definitions,  I chose ‘BorrowerRate’ as my target variable since this number matters  a lot to a potential borrower

## Summary of Findings

>The length of most of the loans are 36 months. The ratings of most of the borrowers in prosper rating are among D to A. Most of borrowers are employed and full-time.(The  Prosper Rating assigned at the time the listing was created: 0 - N/A, 1 - HR, 2 - E, 3 - D, 4 - C, 5 - B, 6 - A, 7 - AA.  Applicable for loans originated after July 2009.

>The Prosper Rating assigned at the time the listing was created between AA - HR.  Applicable for loans originated after July 2009.)
The lowest risk group AA shows highest median loan amount. The result is as expected as people with lower risk have the tendency to take more amount and vice versa.
> We can observe from the graph that the groups of higher risk (HR) took lower loan amount and the groups C, B and A looks like have the same median loan amounts. The lowest risk group AA shows highest median loan amount. The result is as expected as people with lower risk have the tendency to take more amount and vice versa.
>Employeed people are more likely to have a higher loan count of 70,000 thousand and while not available , not employeed , partime have a low loan count of les s than 10,000


>Clents with low income ranges are more likely not to be given loans

> The borrower APR decreases with the better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR. Borrowers with better rating also have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers.

>that is the more the loan amount, the lower the APR. The loan original amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, it makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income could loan more money.

## Key Insights for Presentation
